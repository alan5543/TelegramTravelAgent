## Introduction
The Flight Search MCP Server enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve detailed flight search and information without requiring an API key. Using web scraping, it collects comprehensive data on flights, including prices, schedules, airlines, baggage allowances, and more. This server integrates seamlessly with MCP-compatible clients (e.g., Claude Desktop) to enhance flight search and analysis capabilities.

## Tools
The server provides one tool for scraping flight data, detailed below with its function name, parameters, and return value for clarity:

### `scrape_flights_tool`
- **Function**: `scrape_flights_tool(departure_airport: str, arrival_airport: str, departure_date: str, return_date: Optional[str] = None, adults: int = 2, students: int = 0, children: List[str] = [], plane_type: str = "economy", sort_option: str = "price_a", carry_on_free: Optional[int] = 1, checked_bags_free: Optional[int] = None, stops: Optional[int] = None, max_price: Optional[int] = 6000, alliance: Optional[str] = None, include_airlines: Optional[Set[str]] = None, exclude_airlines: Optional[Set[str]] = None, wifi_only: bool = False, start_index: int = 0, end_index: int = 15) -> str`
- **Description**: Scrapes flight data from Kayak for specified airports and dates, supporting both one-way and round-trip searches with customizable filters and pagination.
- **Parameters**:
  - `departure_airport: str`: 3-letter IATA code for the departure airport (e.g., "YYZ" for Toronto).

  If no flights are found or an error occurs, returns an error message with the total results count (e.g., "No flights found: No flight results found\nTotal results: 0").

## Manual Configuration
To set up the Flight Scraper MCP Server locally:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Set Up UV**:
   Install UV (a Python package and project manager). Follow the official UV documentation for installation instructions.
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install required Python packages using UV:
   ```bash
   uv pip install requests beautifulsoup4 httpx
   ```
4. **Configure MCP Client**:
   Add the following to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop):
   ```json
   "flight-search-mcp": {
       "command": "uv",
       "args": [
           "--directory",
           "YOUR_CLONED_FOLDER",
           "run",
           "main.py"
       ]
   }
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_CLONED_FOLDER` with the path to the cloned repository.

## Remote MCP Server Configuration
The Flight Scraper MCP Server is hosted remotely at [https://smithery.ai/server/@alan5543/flight-search-mcp](https://smithery.ai/server/@alan5543/flight-search-mcp). To use it:
1. Visit [https://smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai) and sign in or create an account.
2. Go to the server page: [https://smithery.ai/server/@alan5543/flight-search-mcp](https://smithery.ai/server/@alan5543/flight-search-mcp).
3. Click "Add to Client" or follow Smithery.ai's integration instructions.
4. Update your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) to use the remote server URL. Check your client's documentation for details on configuring remote MCP servers.
5. Test the connection to confirm the server is accessible and working.
